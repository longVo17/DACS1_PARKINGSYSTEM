# DACS1_PARKINGSYSTEM

The Parking Management System is a Java application that uses Hibernate for the backend and JavaFX for the frontend. This project is part of my coursework at VKU (Vietnam-Korea University of Information and Communication Technology). 

As my first project in my freshman year, it is designed to automate parking operations. This includes managing vehicle entry and exit, calculating fees, and handling monthly subscriptions. The main goal of this application is to give me practical experience with Java programming, working with databases using Hibernate, and developing user interfaces with JavaFX. 

This application is meant for educational purposes and shows basic software engineering concepts, object-oriented programming, and system integration.
